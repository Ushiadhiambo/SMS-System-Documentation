# Long Code (Virtual Number) Two-Way SMS

Businesses acquire dedicated phone numbers for conversation-style SMS.

## How It Works

- Customers text to a standard-looking number.
- The SMS gateway forwards replies to the business system.
- The system provides relevant information or support based on the message content.

### Example Scenario

A delivery company provides a long code for order tracking:

User texts: "TRACK 4567" to +254700123456

System replies: "Your package #4567 is out for delivery, ETA 2 hrs."
