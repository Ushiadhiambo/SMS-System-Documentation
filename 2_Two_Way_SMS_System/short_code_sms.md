# Short Code Two-Way SMS

Businesses rent a short number (e.g., 12345) to handle incoming SMS.

## How It Works

- Users text keywords or phrases (e.g., "JOIN", "VOTE A") to the shortcode.
- The SMS gateway routes these messages to the business's backend system.
- The system processes messages (e.g., vote counting, subscription management).
- Replies are sent automatically via the gateway.

### Example Scenario

A radio station runs a voting campaign:

> "Text VOTE A to 12345 for Artist A or VOTE B for Artist B."

- Listeners send votes via SMS.
- Messages arrive in the radio station system.
- The system tallies votes and sends back confirmation messages.
