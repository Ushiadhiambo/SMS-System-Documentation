# Types of SMS and How They Work

SMS (Short Message Service) messages can be categorized based on their directionality, purpose, and interactivity.

## a) One-way SMS (Unidirectional SMS)

- The business or system sends messages to users' phones.
- Users receive alerts or notifications but cannot reply via the same channel.
- Common for alerts, promotional messages, and notifications.
- **Example:** Transaction alerts from banks.

## b) Two-way SMS (Bidirectional SMS)

- Enables both sending and receiving SMS through the same number or shortcode.
- Replies from users are received, processed, and can trigger automated or manual responses.
- Used for customer support, surveys, polls, service requests, and transactional confirmations.
- **Example:** A farmer sends "PRICE MAIZE" to get the current market prices.

## c) Transactional SMS

- One-way messages triggered by user actions like purchase confirmation or OTP (One Time Password).
- Sent immediately after a specific event.
- **Example:** Sending an OTP for two-factor authentication.

## d) Promotional SMS

- Bulk SMS sent for marketing purposes.
- Usually one-way without expecting replies.
- **Example:** Sales campaign announcements.
